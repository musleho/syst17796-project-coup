# SYST17796 Final Project - Coup
Offline text-based virtual simulation of the card game Coup.

## Background
In the not too distant future, the government is run for profit by a new "royal class" of multinational CEOs.

Their greed and absolute control of the economy has reduced all but a privileged few to lives of poverty and desperation.

Out of the oppressed masses rose The Resistance, an underground organization focused on overthrowing these powerful rulers. 

The valiant efforts of The Resistance have created discord, intrigue, and weakness in the political courts of the nouveau royal, bringing the government to brink of collapse.

But for you, a powerful government official, this is your opportunity to manipulate, bribe and bluff your way into absolute power.

To be successful, you must destroy the influence of your rivals and drive them into exile.

In these turbulent times there is only room for one to survive.

## Setup
The deck is shuffled and each player is given two randomly chosen cards and two coins. Players can review their own cards on their turn, but must not reveal their cards to any other participating player

At the beginning of each turn, a summary table outlining the different actions and counteractions will be displayed to the player. It is, however, best practice to familiarize oneself with the actions and counteractions before beginning the game.

The person who won the last game starts. On the first round, a random player will be chosen to start.

## Objective
The primary object of the game is to reduce all other players' influence to 0.

Each active card in a player's hand represents one point of influence. Therefore, all players start with influence of 2.

When a player loses influence, they must choose a card to reveal. That card's effect is no longer active for the player.

Once a player's influence falls to 0, they are immediately removed from the round.
